This script will generate a Koch Snowflake.

I put this together as a mean to help wrap my mind around recursion.

It pretty much does what I expect it to, but I'm still not sure I really grok recursion, beyond simple examples.

Nevertheless, I think this is pretty cool.

You can move the drawing turtle around by modifying the paramters for jonney.goto(x, y):

jonney.goto(-200,0)

You can also specify the complexity of the snowflake by modifying the paramters of draw_snowflake( 

draw_snowflake(5,5)*
